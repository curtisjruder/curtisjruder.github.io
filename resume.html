        <h1>Professional</h1>
        <p>
            After graduating high school, I went on to study Chemical Engineering at Kansas State University
            and graduated in 2009 at the height of the Great Recession.  
            Through some combination of luck and merit, I had a job lined-up after graduation
            and went on to work at NCRA in McPherson, KS (now CHS Inc).  This was my first professional job,
            and the people and company hold a special place in my heart.  
        </p>
        <p>
            After three years with NCRA, I took a job in Corpus Christ, TX with Flint Hills Resources.  
            I was there for nearly 5 years and was afforded the opportunity to do a lot of really 
            interesting things.  Through my time at FHR, it became more obvious that I was destined to 
            work more closely with software, and I left to chase an opportunity to model the U.S. Refineries
            at a small consultancy in Houston called Baker & O'Brien.
        </p>
        <p>            
            Fast forwarding a few years, we are still in Texas, but we moved from Corpus to Houston in 2017 
            for the job opportunity with Baker & O'Brien.  I'm still modeling the U.S. Refineries as I was
            initially hired to do, but through a combination of automation and process improvements, I've 
            managed to trim my initial position back to a part-time role.  The total man-hours spent on software
            are roughly 15% of that from when I started.
        </p>
        <p>
            Filling the gap I created through automation, I now do consulting in addition to being the only software developer on site.
            As a consultant, I get to solve new and interesting problems for our clients.  As a software 
            developer, I am the sole source of all software related activities for the firm for our commercial
            software product <i>PRISMâ„¢</i> that we license to clients.  I develop it, I sell it, I package it, I ship it... and everything
            in between.  
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to the normal day-to-day expectations,
            I've just recently completed a full codebase conversion from an older, no longer supported 
            technology (VB6) to Visual Studio .Net.  This involved nearly 100,000 lines of executable code that needed
            to ported.  As part of the transition, it also involved a database transition from Microsoft Access to
            SQLite, an update to code version control, transition to object oriented programming techniques, and 
            integration with Microsoft Office 64 bit. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Based upon the seamless transition, better user experience, 
            and performance improvement, the code base conversion was a resounding success.  I've only recently stopped
            having dreams about coding and algorithms.
        </p>
        <p>
            While continuing to fulfill roles of husband, father, and employee, I added student to the list in late
            2016.  
        </p>
        <p>
            From 2016 to 2019, I studied and completed an MBA with Finance Concentration through the University of 
            Texas A&M - Corpus Christi.  
            
            From 2020 to 2022, I studied and will complete a BS of Computer Science degree through Fort Hays State University. 
            
            Interestingly, once complete, I will have a BS from both schools that my parents attended (KSU and FHSU).  
        </p>
        <p>
            Although very time intensive, the combination of the MBA and BS in Computer Science has made for an interesting
            shift in philosophy; I can't look at a software product now without thinking about how it works and if it 
            is financially viable based upon the business plan.
