                                Core responsibility is to create accurate operational model of every refinery in the U.S. and mimic
                                their historical performance.  
                                Objective is to replicate the following elements for prior time periods:

                                Data analysis is refinery specific and incorporates nearly 25,000 data points per analysis period. 
                                Results of modeling efforts are a primary revenue source for the firm, and the refinery models 
                                are leveraged for a variety of consulting assignments.

                                eliminate nearly 200-man hours per month from time commitment for the role.  Previously a fulltime role with support required, the 
                                role now requires one person with one week per month commitment.  Much of the improvement has leveraged 
                                technology, and in addition to being much more efficient, the calibration integrity is superior resulting in more
                                satisfied clients and more accurate results.
