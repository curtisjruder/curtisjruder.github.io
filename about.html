        <h1>About the site</h1>
        <p>
            Thanks for visiting my site!  My primary objective in creating this site has been
            to create my own little space on the internet and provide a playground of sorts for projects.  
        </p>
        <p> 
            Everything you see here was coded by me in HTML, CSS (SASS), and vanilla javascript 
            (yes, even this awesome canvas background and the splash screen).
        </p>
        <p>Feel free to shoot me an 
            <a href="mailto:curtis@cjruder.net">email</a>
              or hit me up on

        <h1>About me</h1>       
        <p>
            I grew up in a small community in western Kansas, and upon graduation from high school, followed
            in the footsteps of my father and brother to attend and graduate from Kansas State University (go cats!).
        </p>

        <p>
            At K-State, I met my now wife, Tiffany, and we married and moved to Texas in 2012.  Since living in Texas,
            we've added two members to our little familiy:  daughter Cora and son Warren.

            In addition to continuing education and professional objectives, I have a lot of
            interests that are hard to keep up with: avid cooker, beer brewer, and sailor (to name a few).  
        </p>
        <p>
            With cooking, I have taken upon myself to cook from home regularly.  The full meal usually involves some combination of meat, starch, beans, and/or vegetable.  
            In addition to the health benefits and cost savings, it gives me a creative outlet.  
            I  have two avid "helpers" in the kitchen....
        </p>

            As for brewing, I explore with various styles and generally have two different beers 
            on tap at any given time.  At the time of writing, I have a Lemon Infused Session IPA and a 
            West Coast inspired Pale Ale on tap. If you're tracking along, you may notice a trend with in my hobbies thus far:  
            creativity and calories.  Unlike cooking which makes the house smell awesome, brewing beer is 
            stinky business.  If we ever buy a house again, I may get relocated to the garage.

            On the sailing front, my father and I share a Hobie 18 which we take into the Gulf of Mexico whenever time allows.
            Tiffany and I took classes while in Corpus and are both ASA 101, 103, and 104 certified.  We 
            looked more seriously at getting a bigger boat while living in Corpus Christi, but Houston and young kids have dampened 
            my enthusiasm for adding boat maintenance to my schedule... for now anyways.
